Tic Tac Toe - Human vs. Computer
I made the assumption that the human always plays first, and thus
the human is always "X". For the AI, I chose to use the alpha-beta
pruning variant of the Minimax algorithm after some brief research
on the subject. I used canvas tags to draw each square on the game
board, and the UI code communicates with the server via AJAX. The
state of a user's game is cached serverside using the memcache API
exposed by Google App Engine.

From a security standpoint: 
There is minimal verification of what is communicated between the 
client and server, and cheating at the game would be relatively trivial
for anyone who had even a basic knowledge of JavaScript. I did not
consider it very important for an application like this to have
strong input sanitization, but I do check the sanity of the key
in order to avoid the possibility for a buffer overflow. In the case
of a web application whose data is of a more sensitive nature, I would
use more thorough input sanitization, and likely force SSL. Theoretically, 
it is possible for one user to guess at the key of another user's game 
session and disrupt it, but the odds of doing so successfully are very slim.
