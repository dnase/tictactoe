Simple tic tac toe game.

It is meant to be deployed to Google App Engine. It should be deployable with minimal if any changes. You will probably need to edit app.yaml with a new unique name in order to deploy it (after creating a new app in the Google developer dashboard for it).

A working demo is playable here: http://extictactoe.appspot.com/
